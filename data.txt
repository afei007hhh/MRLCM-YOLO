Regarding the dataset, due to usage restrictions and copyright/privacy limitations imposed by the data provider, the complete dataset cannot be made publicly accessible. However, to support transparency and facilitate understanding of the dataset characteristics, we have uploaded several representative test images along with detailed descriptions of the data collection process, annotation protocol, and dataset structure. Upon reasonable request, we are able to share additional non-sensitive samples for academic research purposes.
